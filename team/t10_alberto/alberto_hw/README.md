For this app, I installed node.js to work with react for the frontend and express for the backend.
I first worked on the backend in the server.js file from a simple tutorial, then I worked on the frontend in the App.js file, adding a few texts
I also had to install heroku on my mac using brew with the "brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku" command
With the git init command, I created an empty heroku repository, then added my app files to it, and then deployed the app
