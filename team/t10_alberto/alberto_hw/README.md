For this app, I installed node.js to work with react for the frontend and express for the backend.
I first created a react app using the create-react-app command
Once I created the file, I worked on the backend in the server.js file following a tutorial, then I worked on the frontend in the App.js file.
I installed heroku on my mac using brew with the "brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku" command
With the git init command, I created an empty heroku repository, then added my app files to it, and finally deployed the app
