Introduction:
I am a undergraduate senior student in UCSB. I just changed  my major to CS. Also I am very interested in watching japanese anime. Hence this project attracts me a lot.

Project Ideas:
I have two improvements for our application of animelist. Fisrt, we can give endorsement or dislike button for our users. Also, we can provide share button to let users shares their favourite anime to their friends.
Second, we can collect the data of which  top 5 animes are daily recommend for other users to have a try.
